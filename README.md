# Nodejs Microservice Boilerplate

Folder structure for building microservices for a RESTful API using Express.js within a Service Mesh Architecture

This structure organizes your codebase into logical components, making it easier to navigate and maintain. Additionally, having separate directories for configuration, controllers, models, routes, services, and tests promotes modularity and separation of concerns.

## Explanation of each directory

### config/

- **index.js**: Centralized configuration file.
- **database.js**: Database connection configuration.
- **serviceDiscovery.js**: Configuration for service discovery within the service mesh.

### controllers/

- **UserController.js**: Controller responsible for handling user-related HTTP requests and responses.

### middleware/

- **authentication.js**: Middleware for user authentication.
- **validation.js**: Middleware for request validation.

### models/

- **UserModel.js**: Data model representing the structure of user data.

### routes/

- **userRoutes.js**: Route definitions for user-related endpoints.

### services/

- **userService.js**: Business logic layer for user-related operations.

### tests/

- **unit/**
  - **UserController.test.js**: Unit tests for the UserController.
- **integration/**
  - **userIntegration.test.js**: Integration tests for user-related functionality.

### Root

- **gitignore**: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
- **package**.json: Configuration file for npm packages and project metadata.
- **server.js**: Entry point for your Express.js application.

## Patterns for building microservice in nodejs

When building microservices in Node.js, there isn't a single "best" pattern, as the choice depends on various factors such as the complexity of your application, team preferences, scalability requirements, and more. However, some common patterns used for building microservices in Node.js include:

### Module Pattern 

This is the simplest approach where each microservice is implemented as a separate Node.js module. Each module encapsulates its own logic and functionality. While this approach provides simplicity, it may lack some features required for larger-scale microservices architectures.

### Express.js with RESTful APIs

Using Express.js to build RESTful APIs for each microservice is a popular choice. Each microservice is implemented as an independent Express application, exposing a set of HTTP endpoints for communication. This pattern is straightforward and widely adopted in the Node.js ecosystem.

### Event-Driven Architecture

Leveraging event-driven patterns using tools like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or NATS, you can build microservices that communicate asynchronously through events. Each microservice subscribes to relevant events and reacts accordingly. This pattern provides loose coupling between services and enables better scalability and fault tolerance.

### Service Mesh Architecture

Implementing a service mesh using frameworks like Istio or Linkerd allows you to manage communication, authentication, and observability between microservices. Each microservice is responsible for its business logic, while the service mesh handles cross-cutting concerns such as service discovery, load balancing, and circuit breaking.

### GraphQL

Using GraphQL, you can build a unified API gateway that aggregates data from multiple microservices. Each microservice exposes its data through a GraphQL schema, and the gateway orchestrates requests and responses. This pattern provides flexibility for clients to request only the data they need.

### Serverless Functions

Leveraging serverless platforms like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, you can implement microservices as individual functions. Each function is triggered by an event and executes a specific task, allowing for auto-scaling and cost efficiency.

Ultimately, the best pattern for building microservices in Node.js depends on your specific requirements, such as performance, scalability, team expertise, and ecosystem compatibility. It's often beneficial to evaluate multiple patterns and choose the one that best fits your use case. Additionally, you can combine patterns or use frameworks/libraries to simplify development and management of microservices.
