# Nodejs Microservice Boilerplate

Folder structure for building microservices for a RESTful API using Express.js within a Service Mesh Architecture

This structure organizes your codebase into logical components, making it easier to navigate and maintain. Additionally, having separate directories for configuration, controllers, models, routes, services, and tests promotes modularity and separation of concerns.

## Explanation of each directory

### config/

- **index.js**: Centralized configuration file.
- **database.js**: Database connection configuration.
- **serviceDiscovery.js**: Configuration for service discovery within the service mesh.

### controllers/

- **UserController.js**: Controller responsible for handling user-related HTTP requests and responses.

### middleware/

- **authentication.js**: Middleware for user authentication.
- **validation.js**: Middleware for request validation.

### models/

- **UserModel.js**: Data model representing the structure of user data.

### routes/

- **userRoutes.js**: Route definitions for user-related endpoints.

### services/

- **userService.js**: Business logic layer for user-related operations.

### tests/

- **unit/**
  - **UserController.test.js**: Unit tests for the UserController.
- **integration/**
  - **userIntegration.test.js**: Integration tests for user-related functionality.

### Root

- **gitignore**: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
- **package**.json: Configuration file for npm packages and project metadata.
- **server.js**: Entry point for your Express.js application.
